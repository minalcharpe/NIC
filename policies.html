        Life Insurance can be defined as a contract between an insurance policy holder and an insurance company, where the insurer promises to pay a sum of money in exchange for a premium, upon the death of an insured person or after a set period. 
                <br>

        Auto insurance is a contract between you and the insurance company that protects you against financial loss in the event of an accident or theft. In exchange for your paying a premium, the insurance company agrees to pay your losses as outlined in your policy.
                    <br>
                    
                    Your auto policy will cover you and other family members on your policy, whether driving your car or someone elses car (with their permission). Your policy also provides coverage if someone who is not on your policy is driving your car with your.
                    <br>
                    Your personal auto policy only covers personal driving, whether youre commuting to work, running errands or taking a trip. It will not provide coverage if you use your car for commercial purposesâ€”for instance, if you deliver pizzas.
                    <br>
                    Personal auto insurance will also not provide coverage if you use your car to provide transportation to others through a ride-sharing service such as Uber or Lyft. Some auto insurers, however, are now offering supplemental insurance products (at additional cost) that extend coverage for vehicle owners providing ride-sharing services.

        Business insurance coverage protects businesses from losses due to events that may occur during the normal course of business. There are many types of insurance for businesses including coverage for property damage, legal liability and employee-related risks
                <br>
                It is especially important for small business owners to carefully consider and evaluate their business insurance needs because they may have more personal financial exposure in the event of a loss.
                <br>
                If a business owner does not feel he or she has the ability to effectively assess business risk and the need for coverage, they should work with a reputable, experienced and licensed insurance broker. You can obtain a list of licensed agents in your state through your state's department of insurance or the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
                <br>
                Business insurance refers broadly to a class of insurance coverage intended for purchase by businesses rather than individuals.
                <br>
                Businesses seek insurance to cover potential damage to property, to protect from lawsuit, or contract disputes.
