            <h2> <u>Some Important Question Frequently Asked:-</u></h2> <br><br>
            <h3>1. Do I need life insurance?</h3>
            
        <p>
            Not necessarily. If you have no children or dependents whom you support financially,  you might not need a life insurance policy after all. Life insurance aims to provide <br> a solution for those who seek income replacement, mortgage protection, estate planning, leaving a legacy,<br> or burial expenses. However, if someone you love is dependent on you financially, you need life insurance.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>
            2. How can I save money when buying life insurance?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Buying a term life or a combination of term and permanent insurance may help you pay a lower premium. Buying a policy early in life is also a good way to ensure a lower premium.
            <br>
            The older you are, the higher the premiums, and the more risk you have of developing a health condition that could increase your premium even more or disqualify you from getting coverage at all. You can read more about saving on life insurance here.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>
            3. How does the insurance company determine my premium?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Premium rates are typically based on factors such as age, gender, height, weight, health status (including whether or not you use tobacco), and if you participate in high-risk activities or occupations.
 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>
            4. What is a permanent policy?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Permanent policies are typically the best option if you are looking for life-long protection, or an option to accumulate a tax-deferred cash value. A portion of the premium of a permanent policy is used to build up a cash value. The cash value can be used in several different ways, including allowing you to take out a loan against the cash value, or paying your premium after your policy is fully paid up.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>
            5. Once I buy the policy, will I even need to change my insurance coverage?
        </h3>
        <p>
            If you already have a policy, it will usually have a lower premium rate than a new policy you would buy. If you’re buying a permanent policy, the cash value will also be smaller for several years. Keeping all these factors in mind, it might be worth considering a new policy if you have any significant changes in your life circumstances, such as if you:

            Are recently married or divorced <br>
            Have or adopt a child (or became a grandparent) <br>
            Have children or grandchildren who are about to enter college <br> 
            Provide care or financial help to a child or elderly parent <br>
            Receive an inheritance <br>
            Retire (or your spouse retires) <br>
            Start a business <br>
            Change or lose your job or salary <br>
        </p>
            <br>
        <h3>
            6. What does it mean when a policy is “fully paid up?”
        </h3>
        <p>
            “Fully paid up” means that you have paid enough premiums to cover the cost of the policy for the rest of your life, and the company will use the cash value to pay your premiums until you die.
 
        </p> <br>
        <h3>
            7. What happens if I miss a premium payment?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Most policies have a 31-day grace period wherein you can pay the premium with no penalty or interest. If you have a term policy and do not make the payment within this grace period, the insurance company will usually terminate the policy. If you have a permanent policy, you can authorize the insurance company to draw your premium from your policy’s cash value. 
        </p> <br>
        <h3>
            8. What is a contestability period?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Most policies have a life insurance contestability period of two years after you buy the policy. During this time, if the insurance company finds that they issued the policy under misrepresentation or withholding of information by you, they can declare your policy void.
        </p> <br>
        <h3>
            9. What is the “return of premium” feature?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Some term policies have a return of a premium feature that allows for a refund of all or some of the life insurance premiums you paid through the term of the insurance if no death benefit was paid. The premiums for policies with this feature tend to be higher, and you must be careful not to miss any payments throughout the term in order to take advantage of this feature.
        </p> <br>
        <h3>
            10. What are accelerated death benefits?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Some policies have a provision that allows you to collect a significant portion of the death benefit while you are still alive should you become terminally ill. The money can be used at your discretion to pay for medical expenses or even to do specific things with your family and friends while you still can. The amount you take out early will be subtracted from the death benefit payment along with interest.  
        </p> <br>
        <h3>
            11. What is a term policy?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Term insurance plans cover you for a term of one or more years, and it pays a death benefit only if you die in that term. However, even if you don’t die within the term, you have not wasted your money any more than when you buy car insurance but never have an accident. 
        </p> <br>
        <h3>
            12. How much life insurance do I need?
        </h3>
        <p>
            To determine how much life insurance you need, it’s best to look at your surviving family’s immediate, ongoing, and future financial obligations, and compare that with your financial resources. 
        </p> <br>
        <h3>
            13. Am I still eligible for coverage if I have a serious health condition?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Most plans do require medical testing and charge premiums based on the level of risk they assign to you based on the testing. However, even if you are not in top health or have a serious health condition, there are still some options available with guaranteed issue plans, although this comes at the cost of a higher monthly premium and a lower death benefit. 
        </p> <br>
        <h3>
            14. What is a graded benefit life insurance policy?
        </h3>
        <p>
            A graded benefit life insurance is method insurance carriers use to offer coverage for individuals who aren’t in the best of health and otherwise may not qualify for coverage by limiting the death amount payment should they die in the first two or three years.
        </p> <br>
        <h3>
            15. Do I need life insurance for my child?
        </h3>
        <p>
            This depends on who you ask and what they are attempting to sell you. A child’s policy can provide a saving vehicle, the ability to buy more coverage in the future without proving insurability and also pay the death benefit in the event of a child’s death, which can be used for burial expenses. 
        </p> <br>
        <h3>
            16. What is the underwriting process?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The life insurance underwriting process is a method through which carriers assess your risk based on the medical exam (if needed), answers on the application, and databases search results (Medical Information Bureau, prescription database report, and Motor Vehicle Report) to conclude whether or not to approve, deny, or rate up a life insurance policy. 
        </p> <br>
        <h3>
            17. Should I buy no-questions-asked life insurance?
        </h3>
        <p>
            “No-questions-asked life insurance”, also known as guaranteed issue life insurance, is a policy which ensures your acceptance regardless of your current or past health challenges. There are three caveats to these plans. Firstly, there is a graded benefit clause which will not pay the full death benefit amount should you pass away during the first two policy years.  
        </p> <br>

        <h3>
            18. How long does it take to get my policy?
        </h3>
        <p>
            That depends on the insurance company and the type of coverage that you applied for. Generally speaking, the underwriting process for a traditional, fully underwritten process can take anywhere from two to eight weeks. A no-exam or final expense policy can be issued from a few minutes after submission to about two weeks. The delivery time is about a week after the policy’s approval.
  
        </p> <br>
        <h3>
            19. Do I need to take an exam?
        </h3>
        <p>
            If you apply for a traditional policy, then yes, you will have to undertake the exam. However, there are a few companies who offer up to one million dollars of life insurance coverage without the need to go through an exam. Additionally, policies such as final expense are approved on a simplified issue basis, and do not require you to take the exam.  
        </p> <br>
        <h3>
            20. Why do I need to take an exam?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Would you buy a cat in a bag without checking it first? After all, insurers are on the hook for millions if you die soon after getting the policy. They increase their odds by conducting an exam and consequently decide how risky you are to insure. Additionally, they make sure not to insure the unqualified individuals who may have a terminal illness or otherwise are likely to die soon.  
        </p> <br>
        <h3>
            21. What do the insurance companies test for?
        </h3>
        <p>
            A third-party nurse will go over the questions you answered on the application and record your pulse, blood pressure levels, height and weight, and also take a blood sample. Sometimes, depending on your age and the company, a urine sample and EKG will also be required. 
        </p> <br>
        <h3>
            22. What is a death benefit?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Life insurance death benefit is the amount of money the insurance company pays the designated beneficiaries upon the insured’s death, provided the policy was in force at the time of the incident.
        </p> <br>
        <h3>
            23. What is a beneficiary?
        </h3>
        <p>
            A life insurance beneficiary is an individual, entity, trustee, or estate named by the policy owner to collect the death benefit proceeds upon the insured’s death. There are two types of beneficiaries:

            Primary beneficiary: The first one in line to collect the death benefit upon the insured’s death.
            Contingent beneficiary: Also known as a secondary beneficiary, is the second one in line to collect the benefit if the primary beneficiary is deceased. 
        </p> <br>
        <h3>
            24. What is a final expense life insurance?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Final expense life insurance refers to specific protection individuals purchase to cover charges and affairs that are associated with your such as burial, funeral service, or final medical bills. Final expense policies are whole life with a fixed premium amount that lasts for as long as the insured lives. 
        </p> <br>
        <h3>
            25. Which one is better: Term life insurance or permanent?
        </h3>
        <p>
            This question has been debated for as long as life insurance been around. For most, term life insurance will be the preferred choice because it offers the most significant benefit amount for the lowest price. Furthermore, since most expenses aren’t permanent (mortgage balance, young children), getting the most amount of coverage in the most crucial period when the family is young is a sensible option.

            That said, there are a few cases for a permanent policy which can be best used for estate planning or when you buy a small final expense policy.
